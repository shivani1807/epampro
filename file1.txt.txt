Global warming is the long-term rise in the average 
temperature of the Earth's climate system. It is a major aspect 
of climate change and has been demonstrated by direct temperature 
measurements and by measurements of various effects of the warming.
[5][6] Global warming and climate change are often used interchangeably.
[7] But more accurately, global warming is the mainly human-caused increase 
in global surface temperatures and its projected continuation,[8] while climate 
change includes both global warming and its effects, such as changes in precipitation.
[9] While there have been prehistoric periods of global warming,[10] many observed changes
since the mid-20th century have been unprecedented over decades to millennia.[5][11]
